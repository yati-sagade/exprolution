Exprolution
=============

This is a toy example that uses a genetic algorithm to find an expression that
evaluates to a given number. For example, if the target is `42`, an example
solution would be
    
    7*7-7

Note that there are infinitely many solutions to each instance of this problem.
However, we just care about finding one at this point.
